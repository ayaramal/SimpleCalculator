This is a simple calculator program written in C#.

User Input:
The program asks the user to enter two numbers (num1 and num2) and an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).

Performing the Calculation:
Based on the operation entered, the program calculates the result:
If the operation is +, it adds num1 and num2.
If the operation is -, it subtracts num2 from num1.
If the operation is *, it multiplies num1 and num2.
If the operation is /, it divides num1 by num2 (but checks for division by zero and displays an error if that's the case).

Output:
It displays the result of the operation to the user.

Repeat or Exit:
After showing the result, the program asks if the user wants to perform another calculation. If the user types "y", the program allows them to enter new values and repeat the process. If they type "n", it exits the loop.

End of Program:
When the user chooses not to continue, the program thanks them and waits for a key press before closing.
